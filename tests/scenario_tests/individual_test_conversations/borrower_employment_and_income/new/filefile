I'm an Elementary School Teacher, started working on August 20, 2017, which makes it about 6 years of experience. I work for Sunshine Elementary School located at 789 Education Blvd, Chicago, IL, 60614. Unfortunately, I don't have the school's phone number handy. My monthly income is primarily my base salary, which is $4,200. I'm not self-employed and have no ownership interest in any business. Also, I have no special relationships with any employer or party in the transaction.

I am a Registered Nurse, having begun my current employment on January 5, 2020. This gives me over 4 years of experience in this profession. I am employed by City Hospital, which is at 321 Health Way, Los Angeles, CA, 90001. I don’t have the hospital's phone number right now. My monthly earnings consist of a base income of $5,800 and $700 bonuses. I do not engage in any self-employment activities and hold no ownership interests. Additionally, I am not employed by any family member or related to any party in the transaction.
