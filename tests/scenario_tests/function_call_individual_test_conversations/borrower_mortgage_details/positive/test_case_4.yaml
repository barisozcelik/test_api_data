    I'm looking for a loan of $600,000. The purpose is to buy a property for me to live in.
    It's at 852 River Road, Seattle, Washington, 98104. It has 2 units and is valued at $800,000.
    I plan to use it as a second home. It's not a secondary residence for FHA.
    No mixed-use; it's purely residential. And no, it's not a manufactured home.
